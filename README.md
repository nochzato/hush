### Prerequisites

   ```

4. (Optional) Move the binary to a directory in your PATH for easy access:

### Using Go Install

If you have Go installed and configured, you can install Hush directly using:

```bash
go install github.com/nochzato/hush/cmd/hush@latest

After installation, verify that Hush is installed correctly:

```bash
hush version
```

This should display the version of Hush you've installed.
